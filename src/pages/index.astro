        QWOP Capital is a personal investment company. QWOP resonates, but is
        not affiliated with, the classic QWOP game â€” embracing the idea of
        getting as far along your journey as possible in an unorthodox manner.
        The most pivotal facet to the QWOP strategy is the "Do Not Fret" frame
        of mind. Dedicated to trading and investing education, QWOP desires to
        lead a new generation of traders along their journey.
